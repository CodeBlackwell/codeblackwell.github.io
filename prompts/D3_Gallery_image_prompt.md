# D3 Visualization Gallery - Image Generation Prompt

## Project: LLM Training Dataset for Data Visualization

A comprehensive training dataset with 800+ components teaching large language models to generate production-ready D3.js visualizations using TypeScript and React.

## Image Generation Prompt

**Scene Description:**
A breathtaking gallery space where data transforms into art. The scene shows an infinite museum-like hall with floating data visualization frames suspended in mid-air at varying heights and angles. Each frame contains a different stunning D3.js visualization—bar charts morphing into line graphs, network diagrams pulsing with connections, treemaps expanding with color, and scatter plots that seem to dance with data points. At the center, a luminous AI figure is painting new visualizations into existence, translating streams of natural language text (floating on the left) into beautiful charts and graphs (materializing on the right).

**Composition:**

- Center: AI artist figure with brush/wand creating visualizations
- Left side: Floating natural language prompts as ethereal text ("Show me sales by region", "Create a network of connections")
- Right side: The resulting D3 visualizations materializing in golden frames
- Background: Endless gallery with 800+ visualization frames receding into infinity
- Floor: Reflective black surface showing subtle reflections
- Ceiling: Data streams flowing like aurora borealis

**Featured Visualizations (visible in frames):**

- Animated bar chart with gradient fills
- Force-directed network graph with pulsing nodes
- Hierarchical treemap with nested rectangles
- Elegant line chart with multiple series
- Interactive scatter plot with hover states
- Radial/sunburst diagram
- Geographic choropleth map
- Sankey flow diagram

**Color Palette:**

- Gallery background: Deep charcoal (#1A1A2E) with subtle blue undertones
- Visualization frames: Antique gold (#CFB53B) borders
- Primary data colors: Vibrant spectrum—teal (#14B8A6), coral (#F97316), violet (#8B5CF6), amber (#F59E0B)
- AI figure: Luminous white and soft gold glow
- Text prompts: Soft cyan (#67E8F9) with typewriter effect
- Accents: D3's signature orange (#F9A03C)
- Floor reflections: Muted versions of above colors

**Lighting:**

- Warm gallery lighting from above (museum spotlights on each frame)
- The AI figure emanates soft white/gold light as primary source
- Each visualization frame has its own subtle internal glow
- Ambient blue/purple mood lighting from the aurora ceiling
- Reflections on the floor add depth and dimension
- Subtle rim lighting on frames for definition

**Mood/Atmosphere:**
Artistic mastery meets data science. The image should feel like visiting a prestigious art gallery where every masterpiece is a data story. Elegant, sophisticated, and inspiring—showing that data visualization is both an art and a science. The infinite gallery represents the vast collection (800+ components), while the AI artist represents the bridge between language and visual expression.

**Key Visual Elements:**

- TypeScript/React logos subtly embedded in frame corners
- Code snippets floating like gallery plaques beneath each visualization
- Progressive complexity visible (simple charts near front, complex diagrams in back)
- The number "800+" floating as a subtle indicator
- D3.js logo integrated into the AI figure's form or as a subtle watermark
- Responsive/interactive indicators (hover states, click ripples) on some visualizations

**Style References:**

- Museum of Modern Art interior photography
- Inception's impossible architecture
- The Matrix's code aesthetic (but colorful)
- Bloomberg terminal aesthetics (for the data feel)
- Notion/Figma gallery views

**Technical Specifications:**

- Aspect ratio: 21:9 ultrawide (cinematic) or 16:9
- Style: Photorealistic 3D render with artistic stylization
- Render quality: Gallery-worthy, ultra high detail
- Depth of field: Deep, keeping multiple frames sharp with soft background blur
- Post-processing: Subtle film grain, warm color grading, gentle bloom on lights

**Text Overlay Space:**

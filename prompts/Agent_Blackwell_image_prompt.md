# Agent_Blackwell - Image Generation Prompt

## Project: Intelligent Multi-Agent Software Development System

An orchestration framework coordinating 5 specialized AI agents (Planner, Designer, Coder, Test Writer, Reviewer) to automate the complete software development lifecycle.

## Image Generation Prompt

**Scene Description:**
A dramatic aerial view of a futuristic circular command table where five distinct AI agents are seated, each with their own holographic workstation. At the center of the table, a glowing orchestration hub pulses with connecting light beams that flow between each agent, visualizing their communication and collaboration. Each agent is represented as a unique humanoid figure with distinct visual characteristics matching their role. Above the table, a magnificent holographic display shows the current project's progress—code flowing, tests passing, and architecture diagrams evolving in real-time.

**The Five Agents (clockwise from top):**

1. **The Planner** - Sage-like figure with constellation patterns on their form, surrounded by floating timeline nodes and requirement cards
2. **The Designer** - Elegant architect with blueprint projections emanating from their hands, geometric shapes orbiting around them
3. **The Coder** - Dynamic figure with streams of code flowing from their fingertips like digital magic, multiple terminal windows floating nearby
4. **The Test Writer** - Precise figure with checkmark and X symbols orbiting them, test case matrices displayed on their holographic screen
5. **The Reviewer** - Wise observer with magnifying glass motifs, code diff visualizations and approval stamps floating in their space

**Composition:**

- Bird's eye view at 45-degree angle looking down at the circular table
- Central orchestration hub as the focal point with radial symmetry
- Each agent's workspace is a distinct "slice" of the circle
- Light beams connecting agents show workflow progression
- Above: Floating holographic project visualization showing the complete development pipeline
- Below/around: Abstract code and data flowing like streams around the table base

**Color Palette:**

- Central hub: Brilliant white (#FFFFFF) with golden accents (#FFD700)
- Planner: Deep purple (#7C3AED) and silver
- Designer: Cyan (#06B6D4) and white
- Coder: Electric green (#22C55E) and dark terminals
- Test Writer: Orange (#F97316) and checkmark green
- Reviewer: Royal blue (#2563EB) and gold
- Background: Deep space black (#0A0A0A) with subtle star field
- Connection beams: Gradient rainbow representing data flow

**Lighting:**

- Central hub provides primary illumination—warm, inviting glow
- Each agent has their own colored ambient light matching their role
- Dramatic rim lighting on each agent figure
- Volumetric light beams connecting the agents
- Subtle god rays from the overhead holographic display
- Stars twinkling in the deep background

**Mood/Atmosphere:**
Epic collaboration. The image should feel like witnessing a council of digital masters working in perfect harmony. Think Avengers assembling but for software development. Professional yet awe-inspiring—demonstrating that this isn't just automation, it's orchestrated excellence. The viewer should feel they're looking at the future of development.

**Key Visual Elements:**

- Sequential workflow arrows showing Planner→Designer→Coder→Test Writer→Reviewer
- Small project artifacts floating between agents (requirements docs, diagrams, code files, test results, review comments)
- Progress indicators showing each stage completing
- The orchestrator's "heartbeat" pulse visible in the central hub
- Python/code symbols subtly integrated into the table's surface design
- Clock/time elements showing efficiency and speed

**Style References:**

- Marvel's Avengers council room scenes
- Tron: Legacy's digital environments
- Star Trek bridge/war room aesthetics
- Westworld's control room visualizations
- Dune's holographic war tables

**Technical Specifications:**

- Aspect ratio: 1:1 or 16:9 (hero image versatility)
- Style: Cinematic 3D render with slight stylization
- Render quality: Ultra-detailed, movie poster quality
- Depth of field: Moderate, keeping all agents visible but emphasizing center
- Post-processing: Subtle bloom, lens flares on bright elements

**Text Overlay Space:**
Reserve bottom center for tagline: "Five Minds. One Mission. Perfect Code." and project logo placement.

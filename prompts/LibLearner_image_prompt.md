## Image Generation Prompt

**Scene Description:**
A mesmerizing visualization of knowledge extraction and transformation. The scene shows a vast library of code repositories represented as towering bookshelves filled with glowing code scrolls, each representing different programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Jupyter notebooks). At the center, an elegant extraction apparatus—part scientific instrument, part magical artifact—is actively pulling luminous code essence from the repositories. This essence flows through crystalline tubes into a magnificent T5 model brain sculpture that pulses with newly acquired knowledge. The brain grows more intricate and detailed as it learns, with new neural pathways lighting up in real-time.

**Composition:**

- Left side: Towering repository shelves with multi-colored code scrolls (different colors per language)
- Center-left: The extraction apparatus actively pulling code essence
- Center: Crystalline pipeline/tubes carrying processed data
- Center-right: The T5 model brain, beautifully rendered as a transparent neural sculpture
- Right side: Output streams showing the trained model's new capabilities
- Background: Abstract representation of function trees and class hierarchies
- Floor: Subtle grid pattern suggesting structured data processing

**The Three Core Tools Visualized:**

1. **File Processor** (left apparatus): A multi-armed extraction device with CSV output streams
2. **Function Extractor** (center): A precision tool isolating function-shaped light forms
3. **Extension Scout** (scanning beam): A radar-like scanner analyzing file distributions

**Color Palette:**

- Python: Rich royal blue (#3776AB) and golden yellow (#FFD43B)
- JavaScript: Vibrant yellow (#F7DF1E) with dark accents
- Jupyter: Orange (#F37626) with white highlights
- Markdown: Soft gray (#6B7280) with blue links
- T5 Brain: Ethereal white (#F8FAFC) with internal purple (#A855F7) neural glow
- Extraction beams: Laser green (#4ADE80) representing active processing
- Pipeline tubes: Crystal clear with flowing golden data particles
- Background: Deep library brown (#292524) with warm amber lighting

**Lighting:**

- Warm ambient library lighting from above (classic library atmosphere)
- The extraction apparatus emits focused green processing light
- T5 brain provides the brightest glow—pulsing with learned intelligence
- Each code scroll has its own subtle internal illumination
- Volumetric light beams showing data transfer paths
- Firefly-like particles representing processed functions floating in the air

**Mood/Atmosphere:**
Ancient wisdom meets cutting-edge technology. The image should feel like a grand library where code is precious knowledge being carefully extracted and distilled into machine intelligence. Scholarly yet futuristic—respecting the craft of programming while showcasing the power of machine learning. The viewer should feel they're witnessing the birth of specialized AI, custom-trained on their own codebase.

**Key Visual Elements:**

- Multi-language code scrolls (Python .py, JavaScript .js, Jupyter .ipynb, etc.)
- Visible function signatures floating as extracted "specimens"
- Class hierarchy trees growing like bonsai in the background
- Docstrings visualized as illuminated annotations
- GitHub Octocat subtle appearance (representing direct GitHub integration)
- T5 architecture hints visible inside the brain (encoder-decoder structure)
- Progress bars and processing metrics floating near the apparatus
- Apache 2.0 license seal subtly present (representing open source)

**Style References:**

- Beauty and the Beast's enchanted library
- Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum
- Fantastic Beasts' magical artifact aesthetics
- Scientific illustration meets fantasy concept art
- Westworld's host creation sequences

**Technical Specifications:**

- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3 (versatile for various uses)
- Style: Fantasy-meets-sci-fi concept art with photorealistic elements
- Render quality: Book cover/poster quality, rich detail
- Depth of field: Medium, keeping both repositories and T5 brain in focus
- Post-processing: Warm color grading, magical particle effects, subtle vignette

**Text Overlay Space:**
Reserve bottom-center for headline: "Train Your Own Intelligence" and top-right corner for supported format badges (Python, JS, Jupyter, MD, YAML, JSON, Shell).
